# RareFold
Structure prediction and design of proteins with noncanonical amino acids.

**RareFold** predicts single-chain protein structures containing noncanonical amino acids and enables the design of novel peptide binders through the EvoBindRare framework. \
**EvoBindRare** designs both linear and cyclic binders directly from a protein target sequenceâ€”no prior knowledge of binding sites is required (though optional). The framework enables rapid and flexible design with expanded chemical diversity through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids. EvoBindRare has been experimentally validated for both linear and cyclic designs, achieving high-affinity binding in each case.

# Installation
## (several minutes)
The entire installation takes <1 hour on a standard computer. \
We assume you have CUDA12. For CUDA11, you will have to change the installation of some packages. \
The runtime will depend on the GPU you have available and the size of the protein you are predicting. \
On an NVIDIA A100 GPU, the prediction time is a few minutes on average.

First install miniconda, see: https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html or https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-other-installer-links.html


```
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

1. Install the RareFold environment
2. Get the RareFold parameters for single-chain structure prediction
3. Get the EvoBindRare parameters for binder design
4. Get Uniclust for MSA search
5. Install HHblits for MSA search

# Predict using RareFold
Run the test case (a few minutes)
```
conda activate rarefold
bash predict.sh
```
